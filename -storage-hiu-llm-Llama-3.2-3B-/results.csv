I will give a step by step solution to this problem. Let us assume that the number of apples that Bao has is x. So, the number of apples that Hieu has is 5 - x. Since, the number of apples that Hieu has is the square root of the number of apples that Bao has, we can write: (5 - x) = sqrt(100) 5 - x = 10 x = 5 So",1.8216333389282227,8.5

A function f is convex if and only if for all a and b in the domain of f and all t in [0,1], f (ta + (1-t)b) <= tf(a) + (1-t)f(b).
Now, f(x) = x^2 + 1 is a quadratic function, so it is convex.
So f(x) = x^2 + 1 is convex.
